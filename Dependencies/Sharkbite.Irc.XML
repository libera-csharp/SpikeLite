             This class is used to send CTCP specific events. Once registered with this object 
             the client can receive notification of all CTCP requests, pings, and replies. Instances 
             of this class are not created directly but are retrieved as a property from a 
             <see cref="T:Sharkbite.Irc.Connection"/> object.
             </summary>
             <remarks>All CTCP messages come in Request/Reply pairs. Each event
             signals either the Request or the Response. All CTCP queries (with the exception of
             CTCP Ping) are very similiar so they are all handled by the same set of events.</remarks>
            <example><code>
             //Create a Connection object which will support CTCP (second bool param).
             Connection connection = new Connection( args, true, false );	
             //Register a delegate on this CtcpListener.
             connection.CtcpListener.OnCtcpRequest += new CtcpRequestEventHandler( MyOnCtcpRequest );
             //If the Connection was created without CTCP support then this property will return null.
             //However, CTCP can be turned on and off dynamically. To enable it at a later time call:
             connection.EnableCtcp = true;
             //Now you can register listeners as above.
             //Setting EnableCtcp to false will delete the instance of CtcpListener and no more
             //CTCP events will be raised.

            This class is used to send all the IRC commands except for CTCP and DCC
            messages. Instances of this class are retrieved as properties of the Connection
            object. All methods in this class are thread safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>Due to the asynchronous nature of IRC, none of these commands 
            have a return value. To get that value (or possibly an error) the client must
            handle the corresponding event. For example, to check if a user is online
            the client would send <see cref="M:Sharkbite.Irc.Sender.Ison(System.String)"/> then check the value of the 
            <see cref="E:Sharkbite.Irc.Listener.OnIson"/> event to receive the answer.</para>
            <para>When a command can return an error, the possible error replies
            are listed. An error message will be sent via the <see cref="E:Sharkbite.Irc.Listener.OnError"/> event
            with one of the listed error codes as a parameter. When checking for these 
            errors use the constants from <see cref="T:Sharkbite.Irc.ReplyCode"/>.

            <para>The maximum length of any command string sent to the

            generated in response to a WHOIS message. Given that
            there are enough parameters present, the answering
            server MUST either formulate a reply out of the above
            numerics (if the query nick is found) or return an
            error reply. The '*' in RPL_WHOISUSER is there as
            the literal character and not as a wild card. For
            each reply set, only RPL_WHOISCHANNELS may appear
            more than once (for long lists of channel names).
            The '@' and '+' characters next to the channel name
            indicate whether a client is a channel operator or
            has been granted permission to speak on a moderated
            channel. The RPL_ENDOFWHOIS reply is used to mark
            the end of processing a WHOIS message.

            whether it was sent by an operator or not. There
            is no predefined order for which occurs first.
            Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN, RPL_TRACECONNECTING and
            RPL_TRACEHANDSHAKE are all used for connections
            which have not been fully established and are either
            unknown, still attempting to connect or in the
            process of completing the 'server handshake'.
            RPL_TRACELINK is sent by any server which handles
            a TRACE message and has to pass it on to another
            server. The list of RPL_TRACELINKs sent in
            response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
            network should reflect the actual connectivity of
            the servers themselves along that path.
            RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection
            which does not fit in the other categories but is
            being displayed anyway.
            RPL_TRACEEND is sent to indicate the end of the list.
